# Contributing Guidelines

Before making a PR, please create an issue to bring what you're thinking about into discussion, so others who may have the same idea do not create similar PRs. :)

**IMPORTANT**: If you make any contribution to any component, you need to update the version of that component in the component README file. For example: if you're creating a new component, add Version 1.0 to the documentation, or if you're updating a component, you need to add a .1 to the version and make sure and UPDATE THE README if need be.

When contributing to this project, you need to decide what category you fall in by picking one of the three categories for your PR below:

### Refactor

- improving the codebase but not fixing or adding a new feature

### Fix

- a bug that is causing issues in the codebase

### Feature

- adding a new component to the component-library directory or adding a new feature to an existing component

Anytime you create a PR, you need to make sure you prefix the beginning of your PR with the category your PR falls in. For example, if you're refactoring part of the codebase, your PR needs to start with:

```bash
	refactor-form-input-props
```

Other examples include:

```bash
	fix-form-input-prop-types
	feature-form-checkbox-component
```

**NOTE**: I understand these guidelines aren't the best, but I promise I will make an effort to continue improving them. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

Happy Coding :)
